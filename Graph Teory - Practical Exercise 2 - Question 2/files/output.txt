This program  is responsible to  find a path between
a Manager Machine and another machine. The user only
input the name of the  machine that he want find the
path.
!Observation: As the imported graph is not directed,
the  edge {a, b} is equals to {b, a}.  Where a and b
are any vertices of the imported GML graph.
